## üß† Introduction

- Hello! My name is Michael Thomas and I am close to completed with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have been in the SNHU program for over two years, starting originally in the Fall of 2022. Some of my favorite coursework and concepts learned thus far include Front-end/Back-end Development, Systems Architecture, and Iterative Design. Prior to my time in school I had little knowledge of the structures behind software development and computer systems, but I have always had an itching curiosity.
- From a young age I have always pursued the dream of becoming a video game designer, unwavering on my dream, I plan on using this education as the first stepping stone into the field. Luckily, SNHU provided the opportunity to work with other students on a game project creating [Sugar Rush](https://sirrell.itch.io/sugar-rush) (_A cute, third-person racing game made in Unreal Engine_), giving me a glipse into my dream career field. I am extremely thankful for the learning I have experienced thus far, especially my new programming mindset, where I am finally able to understand complex systems and break down difficult challenges. However, I have an insatiable desire to learn, so finding a career that continues to develop my skills and require frequent education and exploration is extremely important to me. 
- Throughout this GitHub page you will find various journals, narratives, and code assignments relating to three major Computer Science categories: Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. Feel free to browse my original and enhanced versions, alongside my initial plan and code review. I chose to revisit my coursework completed in _CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance_ for the first two categories; Software Engineering and Design and Algorithms and Data Structures. For the final category, Databases, I updated coursework from _IT 145: Foundation in Application Development_. My improvements display development in understanding of five course outcomes while simultaneously showing my analysis, planning, problem solving, and organizational skills. 

## üóíÔ∏è Self-Reflection Journals

These journals were written throughout the capstone course and offer additional insight into how my academic experiences shaped my goals and technical evolution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Review & Enhancement Planning

üìπ **Code Review Video**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ylHAz0zElCw)

üìÑ **Enhancement Plan**: [Download Plan (docx)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/blob/main/CS%20499/CS%20499%20Module%20One%20Assignment.docx)

üìì **Journal Entry**: [Code Review Journal](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/blob/main/Journals/2-1%20Journal.docx)

- This section documents my approach to enhancement planning and structured code review. The journal entries reflect on the importance of peer code reviews, industry best practices, and my strategy behind my example. The planning document outlines how I chose enhancements that align with course outcomes in software design, algorithm efficiency, and database integration. I also utilized a checklist provided by SNHU, helping me review in an organized manner. 


## üß± Artifact One: Software Design and Engineering

**Original**: [AppointmentService (Java)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/tree/main/Original%20Artifacts/CS%20320/Appointment%20Service)

**Enhanced**: [AppointmentService (Python)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/tree/main/Enhanced%20Artifacts/ENHANCED%20CS%20320/Appointment%20Service)

**Narrative**: [Narrative Document](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/blob/main/Narratives/3-2%20Milestone%20Two%20Narrative.docx)

![Artifact One Screenshot](Screenshots/Artifact%20One%20-%20Before%20and%20After%20Code%20Comparison.png)

- This artifact showcases a task-tracking application originally developed in Java and later refactored in Python to improve code readability, robustness, and maintainability. The enhanced version includes object-oriented restructuring, exception handling, and a Pytest testing suite. This project demonstrates my ability to apply TDD principles and best practices in software design.

## üìä Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

**Original**: [ContactService (Java)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/tree/main/Original%20Artifacts/CS%20320/Contact%20Service)

**Enhanced**: [ContactService (Python)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/tree/main/Enhanced%20Artifacts/ENHANCED%20CS%20320/Contact%20Service)

**Narrative**: [Narrative Document](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/blob/main/Narratives/4-2%20Milestone%20Three%20Narrative.docx)

![Artifact Two Screenshot](Screenshots/Artifact%20Two%20-%20Contact%20Lookup%20Comparison.png)

- Originally using an ArrayList for contact storage, this program was optimized using a HashMap (Python dictionary) to enable constant-time operations. The enhancement reduced redundancy and improved clarity by modularizing logic and adding helper methods. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and strategic data structure use.


## üíæ Artifact Three: Databases

**Original**: [GraziosoSalvare (Array)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/tree/main/Original%20Artifacts/IT%20145/GraziosoSalvare)

**Enhanced**: [GraziosoSalvare (SQLite)](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/tree/main/Enhanced%20Artifacts/ENHANCED%20IT%20145)

**Narrative**: [Narrative Document](https://github.com/thomasxvii/thomasxvii.github.io/blob/main/Narratives/5-2%20Milestone%20Four%20Narrative.docx)

![Artifact Three Screenshot](Screenshots/Artifact%20Three%20-%20GraziosoSalvare%20Conversion.png)

- The original CLI program lacked persistent storage, relying on arrays and temporary file outputs. The refactored version introduces a normalized SQLite database with full CRUD functionality, secure parameterized queries, and schema design. This demonstrates my ability to design scalable data systems with modular code and persistent backends.
