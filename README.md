# CS499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio
###### A display of growth within my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University

## Introduction

- Hello! My name is Michael Thomas and I am almost completed with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have been in the SNHU program for over two years, starting originally in the Fall of 2022. Some of my favorite coursework and concepts learned thus far include Front-end/Back-end Development, Systems Architecture, and Iterative Design. Prior to my time in school I had little knowledge of the structures behind software development and computer systems, but I have always had an itching curiosity. From a young age I have always pursued the dream of becoming a video game designer, unwavering on my dream, I plan on using this education as the first stepping stone into the field. Luckily, SNHU provided the opportunity to work with other students on a game project creating [Sugar Rush](https://sirrell.itch.io/sugar-rush) (_A cute, third-person racing game made in Unreal Engine_), giving me a glipse into my dream career field. I am extremely thankful for the learning I have experienced thus far, where I am finally able to understand complex systems and accomplish goals with my newly learned programming mindset. However, I have an insatiable desire to learn, so finding a career that continues to develop and require education and exploration is extremely important to me. 
- Throughout this GitHub page you will find various journals, narratives, and code assignments relating to three major Computer Science categories: Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. Feel free to browse my original and enhanced versions, alongside my initial plan and code review. I chose to revisit my coursework completed in _CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance_ for the first two categories; Software Engineering and Design and Algorithms and Data Structures. For the final category, Databases, I converted coursework from _IT 145: Foundation in Application Development_. My improvements display development in understanding of five course outcomes while simultaneously showing my analysis, planning, problem solving, and organizational skills.
