      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Completing the Computer Science program has allowed me to develop a wide range of technical and professional skills that I’ve showcased throughout this ePortfolio. The experience of compiling this portfolio has helped me clearly define my strengths in algorithm design, full-stack programming, and systems analysis, and has reinforced my passion for working independently before moving to collaborative environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        My coursework has strengthened my ability to work in team settings, such as in collaborative assignments and peer review discussions. It also helped me refine how I communicate technically with different audiences, including peers, instructors, and potential stakeholders. I’ve used industry-standard tools and practices—like GitHub, agile principles, and version control—which I’ve carried into the work showcased here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifacts you’ll see reflect my skills in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, security-aware development, and database management. My interests in solo development and practical problem-solving guided my artifact enhancements, allowing me to explore design trade-offs, efficient solutions, and secure, scalable implementations. Together, these artifacts represent the complete story of my growth as a developer ready to join the professional field.

      <article>
        <h3>Artifact 1: Algorithm Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          This artifact demonstrates an enhancement to a pathfinding system. I reworked the logic to reduce processing time using A* and binary heaps. It reflects a deeper understanding of data structures and design trade-offs.

      <h2>Artifact Narratives</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Reflection: Algorithm Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          This artifact reflects my growing understanding of algorithmic complexity. While implementing the A* algorithm, I faced challenges in performance tuning, which required a deeper dive into data structure selection. Peer feedback was helpful in identifying inefficiencies, which I corrected by restructuring the loop logic and optimizing memory usage. This enhancement directly supported my grasp of outcomes 2, 3, and 4.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Reflection: Full-Stack MongoDB Application</h3>
        <p>
          Enhancing this artifact helped me become comfortable with the MERN stack. I focused on improving backend security and data integrity. I learned how to secure APIs, handle user data safely, and provide a clean front-end experience. Incorporating security mindset principles made me much more confident in deploying full-stack applications. This artifact supported my achievement of outcomes 2, 4, and 5.
